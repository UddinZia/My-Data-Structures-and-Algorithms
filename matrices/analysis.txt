The plot of the runtime vs matrix size grew in an exponential fashion. With the increase in matrix size, the runtime increased dramatically.
This is due to the way I designed my algorithm for calculating the Kronecker product. The time complexity of my algorithm ended up being O(n^4). 
My algorithm consisted of 4 nested for-loops that looped through the rows and columns of matrix A and B in order to compute the Kronecker product.
